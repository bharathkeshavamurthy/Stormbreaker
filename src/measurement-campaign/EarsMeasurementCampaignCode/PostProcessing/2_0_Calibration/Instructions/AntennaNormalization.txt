Ok, for the antenna files -- even though it looks complicated -- it's really pretty simple.  Basically this is the data from a Vector Network Analyzer S21 parameter measurement.

The first column is the angle at which the measurement was made (azimuth angle or elevation angle depending on the file).

The next series of columns are the discrete frequencies where each measurement was made.  I swept 1601 points from 2-3 GHz (27.5-28.5 GHz), so there's 1601 discrete frequencies.

Each frequency has a specific S21 measurement associated with it -- you can think of it as the channel transfer function, or the loss between the transmitter and receiver.  In this case, that loss is the free-space loss plus the effects of the transmitter and receiver antenna gains.  Because its a vector measurement, there's two columns for each frequency -- the first column is the magnitude and the second is the phase.  For our purposes, we can ignore the phase measurement.

All you really need is the 2.5 GHz column, magnitude data to go with the first column (angle of measurement).  I believe it's reported in linear units, so you'll have to do either 10log or 20log.
