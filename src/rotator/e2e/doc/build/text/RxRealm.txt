RxRealm module
**************

This script describes the operations performed by the controller at Rx
side of the Odin channel statistics measurement campaign. The
operations performed by this controller include:

   a. Receive the custom NMEA-formatted location messages from the
   microcontroller over the USB/BT serial COM port
   (SerialUSB/SerialBT): (The Rx uC-based (RxController.ino)
   operations are detailed below)

      1. Use the uC-GPS parser library to parse the standard NMEA GPS
      messages and obtain the time, latitude, longitude, altitude,
      heading, velocity, and other metadata metrics from the getter-
      setter methods within this library; and

      2. Using these extracted data values construct a custom NMEA-
      formatted message (start with $ and the ordered data values are
      comma-separated) and publish it to the USB/BT serial COM port
      within the Rx uC-based code (SerialUSB/SerialBT)

   b. Parse the received custom NMEA-formatted location messages to
   populate a JSON data object which would next be encapsulated in an
   ODIN_GPS_EVENT; and

   3. Publish the created ODIN_GPS_EVENT to the Kafka topic
      ODIN_GPS_EVENTS.

DESIGN NOTE: The RTCM correction stream is sent to the GPS module from
an NTRIP client (Lefebure Windows Client) over another Bluetooth link
with the same BT module.
