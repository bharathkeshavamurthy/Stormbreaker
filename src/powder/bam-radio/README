# Summary

BAM! Radio is a Cognitive Intelligent Radio Network (CIRN) design and
implementation for the DARPA Spectrum Collaboration Challenge (SC2).

# Compilation

The `util/container-build` directory contains build scripts to create a
self-contained LXC container image.

## Dependencies

BAM! Radio depends on the following software components for compilation and at
runtime. The specified versions are known to be compatible.

* CMake 3.10
* GCC 6.3
  - CUDA doesn't support GCC 7 yet.
* NVIDIA CUDA 9.1
* Boost 1.66
* UHD 3.9 LTS (UHD-3.9.LTS branch)
* GNU Radio 3.8 (sgl/next++ branch)
* Google Protobuf 3.3.2
* ZeroMQ 4.2.1
* FFTW 3.3.6

build-essential gcc-6 g++-6 cuda-9-1
```

The remaining dependencies may be installed from source. Helper scripts exist
in `util/dependencies`.

## Phase 1

The Phase 1 radio code primarily exists in the `controller` directory.  The
code may be built with CMake.
