A table of metrics for Project Odin:

1. PT2645-S and uC-IMU rotational accuracy: Yaw rotation testing on the laser test-bed | Fine and Coarse Analyses with/without multiple trials
   a. Single Trial:
				Fine: \{3^𝑜:〖0.98〗^𝑜, 6^𝑜:〖1.035〗^𝑜, 9:〖2.885〗^𝑜, 12^𝑜:〖2.145〗^𝑜, 15^𝑜:〖2.075〗^𝑜, 18^𝑜:〖0.755〗^𝑜 \}
				Coarse: \{15^𝑜:〖2.925〗^𝑜, 30^𝑜:〖1.27〗^𝑜, 45^𝑜:〖0.88〗^𝑜, 60^𝑜:〖0.605〗^𝑜, 75^𝑜:〖0.495〗^𝑜, 90^𝑜:〖0.66〗^𝑜 \}
   b. Multiple Trials (x3 per angle):
				Coarse: \{30^𝑜:〖2.41〗^𝑜, 60^𝑜:〖1.843〗^𝑜, 90^𝑜:〖2.46〗^𝑜 \}
   c. Average Error across multiple rotational mandates (fine [in steps of 3 degrees] & coarse [in steps of 15 degrees]) -- averaged over several iterations per angle = 1.1153 degrees
   
2. GPS positional accuracy: During Tx installation (static) | Verified on uBlox u-Center and on the uC Serial Monitor over Qwiic I2C | UBX-NAV HPPOSLLH messages
   a. RTCM3.0 messages over NTRIP from a UNAVCO NTRIP caster (rtgpsout.unavco.org | 
   b. 2D Accuracy = 9 cm
   c. 3D Accuracy = 17 cm
   d. Satellites in View = 28 (GNSS: GPS | GLONASS | Galileo | BeiDou)
   
3. Inter-Realm Response Time over Apache Zookeeper-Kafka = 27.794 ms 
   a. All Realms and the Realms Controller -- including Kafka, Zookeeper, and Logging -- were executed on 4-core x86-64 Intel i5-1035G7 CPU @1.20GHz with 8 GB of RAM, on both Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa and Windows 10 b. Carried out over 12,870 messages that were exchanged between the TxRealm and RxRealm over Kafka.
   c. This response time constitutes the time taken for the complete processing of one mandate:
		Get recent Rx GPS event | Log & Send this event to the Tx over Kafka | Get this event at the Tx | Parse & Log the event at the Tx | Issue a rotation mandate to the servos
