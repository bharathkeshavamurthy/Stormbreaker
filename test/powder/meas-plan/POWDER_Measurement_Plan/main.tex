\section{Objective \& Background}
    The objective of this measurement campaign is to obtain a reasonably large dataset of site-specific signal propagation characteristics for experimenting Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) algorithms in mmWave radio ecosystems. Measurements will be performed on the NSF PAWR POWDER-RENEW testbed at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, UT, to emulate typical $5$G (and beyond) deployments in urban and suburban environments. The Tx will be temporarily installed at designated points on the roof of several buildings at the University of Utah (e.g., University of Utah Hospital Building, Behavioral Sciences Building, etc). The Rx, on the other hand, would be mounted on top of a van, and driven around campus along pre-determined routes (e.g., Blue Detour, Suburban, etc) to collect these geographically correlated measurements -- intended to be used for transmission loss evaluations in direct-link large-scale propagation modeling and for beam-steering/multipath evaluations under different \gls{aod}/\gls{aoa} values. \\

    \noindent Electromagnetic signals in the mmWave bands are expected to experience more attenuation over distance and be extremely sensitive to obstacles in the environment. To take full advantage of the vast mmWave bandwidth to be available in next-generation radio access technologies, service providers will need channel information based on Tx and Rx locations in both planning and operating these networks: a comprehensive channel measurement dataset with detailed geographic information is the key to fostering these site-specific mmWave channel models. In this measurement campaign, we would like to create such a dataset for urban and suburban environments at $28$GHz. Two types of measurement results are planned to be extracted: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Transmission loss assessments of the direct link between a fixed Tx and a mobile Rx covering a reasonably large geographic area (${\approx}1$ sq. km) for large-scale site-specific propagation modeling, and
        \item Transmission loss assessments at pre-determined Rx locations with a pre-assigned combination of different \gls{aod}/\gls{aoa} values for multipath evaluation.
    \end{itemize}

\section{Methodology}

            \label{fig:map}
        \end{figure}
        The measurement campaign will be conducted using a pair of autonomous antenna tracking platforms -- one at the Tx and another at the Rx -- developed under Project Odin at Purdue University, in collaboration with Dr. Chris Anderson of the United States Naval Academy (USNA). Details about our sounder design at $28$GHz are provided in Sec. \ref{S3.5}, and details about our autonomous antenna tracking platforms are outlined in Sec. \ref{S3.6}. Finally, introducing our playground, \Cref{fig:map} depicts our arena for this measurement campaign -- constituting both urban and suburban environments in and around the University of Utah.

    \subsection{Potential Mobile Rx Routes}\label{S3.3}
    Although some of the following routes match the routes of the ``mobile nodes" (shuttles) available on the POWDER testbed, we do not intend to use these shuttles for our measurement campaign; instead, we would provision a van on our own and mount our Rx setup on top of it.

    \subsection{Rx Chosen Routes}\label{S3.4}
    Of the potential Rx route candidates listed in Sec. \ref{S3.3}, based on our internal discussions, we have decided to use the ``Blue Detour" route for urban measurements and the ``Suburban" route for suburban measurements. As a result, the corresponding Tx mount points are chosen to be the roof-top of the University of Utah Hospital building (for the ``Blue Detour" route) and the roof-top of the Behavioral Sciences building (for the ``Suburban" route).\newline
    
    \noindent The other routes listed in Sec. \ref{S3.3} will serve as backups in case we encounter unforeseen circumstances during our measurement runs along the chosen routes.
    
    \subsection{Resource Availability and Provisioning}
        A detailed list of roof-top base-stations, near-edge computing resources (at the Fort Douglas datacenter), and Emulab compute nodes -- along with their availabilities during our measurement campaign ($8$-June-$2021$ to $18$-June-$2021$) is provided in \Cref{fig:avail}.\newline
        
        \noindent As of writing this measurement plan, we do not intend to use the USRP radios available at the various Tx mount-point candidates (Sec. \ref{S3.2}), i.e., the fixed end-points and roof-top base-stations; instead, we would be leveraging the flexible BYOD capabilities of the POWDER testbed by integrating an internally developed $28$GHz communication system (detailed in Sec. \ref{S3.5}) with our autonomous antenna tracking system (Sec. \ref{S3.6}). However, we plan to provision compute nodes -- either near-edge computing resources or compute nodes from the Emulab/Cloudlab clusters -- for fault-tolerant data storage, global system installations, centralized coordination of our Tx and Rx autonomous antenna rotating platforms (via Docker, Apache Zookeeper, Apache Kafka, and RPyC distributed control), and to handle offloaded processing tasks from our Tx and Rx end-points. As a result, resource provisioning scripts have been written to orchestrate the following capabilities: node (and Linux image) provisioning, package installations, startup shell script executions, and SCM clones (main repository and sub-modules). A sample Python script involving a geni-lib resource request for a Dell PowerEdge R740 server (d740 near-edge compute resource) is shown in \Cref{fig:profile}.\newline
        
        \noindent As mentioned earlier, our Rx autonomous antenna tracking platform along with its $28$GHz communication setup, would be mounted on a van and driven around the University of Utah along pre-determined routes (Sec. \ref{S3.4}); while our Tx autonomous antenna tracking platform along with its $28$GHz communication setup, would be affixed atop suitable route-specific mount-points (Sec. \ref{S3.4}).\newline
        
        \noindent During a particular run of this measurement campaign, both the Tx and Rx antenna tracking platforms log their IMU (pan \& tilt) and GPS (NMEA-JSON) measurements locally -- along with distributed, redundant storage at the provisioned compute nodes, facilitated by Apache Kafka; additionally, time-stamped power delay profile samples (swept at $2.5$GHz at the Rx) would be logged onto the file-system of an Rx-mounted Raspberry Pi via a USRP B$200$mini GNURadio implementation -- which would be published to the aforementioned fault-tolerant Apache Kafka message-oriented middleware framework.

            \item Fig. \ref{fig:gantt-urban} illustrates our on-site timeline for system integration, installation, and calibration -- along with our plans for data collection while traversing the ``Blue Detour" route - with the Tx mounted on the roof-top of the University of Utah Hospital Building (ACC); and
            \item Fig. \ref{fig:gantt-suburban} illustrates our plans for data collection while traversing the ``Suburban" route - with the Tx mounted on the roof-top of the Behavioral Sciences Building -- along with our on-site timeline for system un-installation, dis-assembly, and packaging.
        \end{itemize}
    
    \subsection{Requirements to be fulfilled by POWDER Support}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Near-edge computing resource(s) and/or Cloudlab/Emulab compute node(s) provisioning;
            \item Authorizations (FCC experimental license) to utilize the $27-29$GHz spectrum; and
            \item BYOD flexibility, i.e., authorizations and support to install the Tx at designated mount-points around the University of Utah campus:
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The base mount schematics for our Tx-side antenna rotating platform are shown in \Cref{fig:schematics}: the plan is to mount this platform via a $3/8$'' carriage bolt, and $1/4{-}20$ UNC \& $\#6{-}32$ UNC fasteners in $3$'' hub-patterns. If this hole-pattern is not available at an installation point, we plan to augment/modify the rotator's base mount to achieve compatibility (e.g., via \href{https://www.servocity.com/side-tapped-pattern-mount-f/}{\textcolor{blue}{side-tapped pattern mounts}}, \href{https://www.servocity.com/brackets/}{\textcolor{blue}{U-brackets}}, etc).
                \item No network back-haul links are needed at the Tx mount-points; instead, a laptop would be used to log the Tx-side IMU measurements. We would like to have these measurements periodically written-through to a fault-tolerant storage mechanism on a provisioned compute node: so, a good WiFi connection is preferred (not absolutely necessary).
                \item Since the Tx employs an antenna rotating platform, our system does not mandate directionality constraints during installation -- although, the Tx-side antenna rotating platform would need to be appropriately mounted to facilitate $360^\text{o}$ of rotation.
                \item Facilitate access to power for our \href{https://www.keysight.com/us/en/assets/7018-06785/data-sheets/5968-9726.pdf}{\textcolor{blue}{programmable DC power-supplies}} (x$2$): one of these is employed to output $12$V/$0.64$A for the $28$GHz antenna and up-converter system, while the other $12$V/$0.4$A for the PN-sequence generator and the ZFL-$1000$ amplifier.
                \item Facilitate weather protection at the chosen Tx sites (Sec. \ref{S3.4}):
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item Our Tx communication circuit components (\Cref{fig:Tx-mini}) and the ICs corresponding to our Tx-side antenna rotating platform (\Cref{fig:Tx-ICs}) would be encased in separate weather-proof ABS enclosures -- along with the required weather-proof protections for any cables/wires coming-out/going-into these enclosures.\label{item1}
                    \item Our $28$GHz antenna and up-converter setup does not currently have a weather-proof dome encasing it. If this setup is to be mounted at a location where appropriate weather protections cannot be provided, we plan to design the required enclosure to weather-proof this setup.
                    \item The \href{https://www.servocity.com/pt2645-s-pan-tilt/}{\textcolor{blue}{PT2645-S Pan \& Tilt kit}}, i.e., the base antenna rotator platform, does not need weather-proofing -- however, the servo wires on this platform are weather-proofed as a part of \Cref{item1}.
                    \item The regulated power-supplies for our $28$GHz antenna and up-converter setup, ZFL-$1000$ amplifier, and PN-sequence generator would need to be placed in suitable locations at the installation point such that they are protected from adverse weather conditions.
                \end{enumerate}
            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
    
\section{Sliding Correlator Channel Sounder Design}\label{S3.5}
    Our $28$GHz sliding correlator channel sounder is the same one used by us in the past for our USNA suburban measurement campaign \cite{8422820}, now integrated with our autonomous antenna tracking system (Sec. \ref{S3.6}). \Cref{fig:blocks} illustrates the overall system structure for the sounder at both the Tx and the Rx. The corresponding specifications are listed in \Cref{tab:specs}. \newline
    
    \noindent For all measurements, the pseudo-random noise (PN) rate will be set to ${\approx}400$MHz and the PN code will be an $11$-bit (length${=}2047$) sequence. The transmitter and receiver both utilize a vertically polarized horn antenna with $10^\text{o}$ half power beam-width.

        \label{fig:arch}
    \end{figure}
    To ensure the antenna alignment between a fixed Tx and a mobile Rx (along both the ``pitch" and ``yaw" axes), we have implemented an autonomous antenna rotator system\footnote{Some demonstration screenshots and videos for the system can be found on \href{https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive/0wfVsZTUo2RYsgWSQ9IMFRSYA\#Demo_Videos}{\textcolor{blue}{iCloud}}.} involving micro-controllers, IMUs, RTK-GPS modules, pan \& tilt kits, USRP B200mini SDRs, and Raspberry Pi micro-computers -- the system architecture for which is illustrated in \Cref{fig:arch}, and the associated software is encapsulated in a GitHub repository, Odin~\cite{odin}. More details about our autonomous antenna tracking system under Project Odin can be furnished upon request.
